# A-Level NEA
My A-Level NEA Project in 2021. It is a 2 player local co-op game, with a randomised level generation and enemies approach the player.
The main mechanic is that the 2 players have to stay close together throughout the level and the goal is to get a high score.

Uses raylib v4.5 as a library for rendering and inputs.

Looking back, raylib should be included as a submodule and using a build system to compile both raylib and the game.
Something like [this](https://github.com/CapsCollective/raylib-cpp-starter).

DLL files shouldn't be included but may be required.

Note: It is just a copy of the code for submission.
